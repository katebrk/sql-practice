Table: Failed

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| fail_date    | date    |
+--------------+---------+
fail_date is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the days of failed tasks.
 

Table: Succeeded

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| success_date | date    |
+--------------+---------+
success_date is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the days of succeeded tasks.
 

A system is running one task every day. Every task is independent of the previous tasks. The tasks can fail or succeed.

Write a solution to report the period_state for each continuous interval of days in the period from 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.

period_state is 'failed' if tasks in this interval failed or 'succeeded' if tasks in this interval succeeded. Interval of days are retrieved as start_date and end_date.

Return the result table ordered by start_date.

The result format is in the following example.
| period_state | start_date | end_date   |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| succeeded    | 2019-01-01 | 2019-01-03 |
| failed       | 2019-01-04 | 2019-01-05 |
| succeeded    | 2019-01-06 | 2019-01-06 |
